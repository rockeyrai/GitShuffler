# GitShuffler 🚀

**GitShuffler** is an automation utility designed to migrate local codebases to new GitHub repositories with a customized, distributed commit history. It intelligently spreads file commits across a team and a specified timeline to create a realistic project pulse.

## ✨ Features
* **Team Attribution:** Distribute commits among multiple team members.
* **Timeline Simulation:** "Backdate" commits to fit a specific development sprint or hackathon window.
* **Humanized Intervals:** Uses randomized time gaps between commits to mimic natural coding patterns.
* **Auto-Initialization:** Handles the `git init`, `remote add`, and `push` workflow automatically.
